Step 1: Crete a git repo
clone it using git bash

2: Now create new project in inteelij select spring.io project
it will give various options to slectt
chose web app
tymleaf for templates
sql,h2 data bases
etc etc

Now it will ask the directory where to create this project. Select the same directory where we have did clone as it will automatically link
this project to git.
TIll now git will just have readme but as soon we will create this project in that direcotyr it will add those files in it.
now git add
git commit
git push.


3: Start your project by building maven dependencies
Goto: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/guru.springframework/chuck-norris-for-actuator/0.0.2

In Maven tab copy: 
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/guru.springframework/chuck-norris-for-actuator -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>guru.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>chuck-norris-for-actuator</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.2</version>
</dependency>

Put this is pom.xml between any dependecy tag.

So what is really a maven dependency:
Chuck Norris for Actuator is a Spring application that JT has created and published to Maven central. 
The app for the purpose of demo, returns a random Joke as a string. 
In the video, we are using the Chuck Norris app as a dependency of our Joke application. 
The video demonstrates how we add the Chuck Norris app as a Maven dependency to our Joke application, and then use it from a service class of the application.


Step4 :
As we have imported Maven dependecnty and role of that was to return any random joke.
Now we will create a service in our project. I.e how we will get a joke i,e service to get a joke

This has a class and which has method which will give us jokes.
We can now easily create its object and get the joke.
